# TIPE 2023 - BGEYSNU : A Non Euclidean Game Engine
My submission for the 2023 TIPE (Travail d'Initiative Personelle Encadr√©). BGEYSNU stands for bad game engine you should never use.

# What's the TIPE ?

It's a project you conduct on a specific theme to present at your oral exams in CPGE (french schools made to enter engineering schools). It stands for (in english) supervised self-initiative work. Essentially, you're presented a theme (in 2023 it was Games and Sports) and you have to come up with a project that you will conduct entirely by yourself, in order to show your abilities at conceptualizing an idea, laying it down, making models to verify your idea, etc.

# Why a github repo ?

I'm way too scared to loose some files and i prefer putting them online. It's also easier for me to link ppl to this page if i need their help. And i also think this kind of project is cool to post on github.

# How is the repo organized ?

Code files are in the code branch. The maths, physics and theorical computer science things behind are in the sciency-stuff branch. It also contains tex files that synthesize my results, comments, logs, references etc. Essentially, all that's interesting for academical purposes it in that folder, while the code itself is in the other folder.

Have fun swimming through this whole mess
