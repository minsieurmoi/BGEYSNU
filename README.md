# TIPE 2023/24 - How can hyperbolic geometry defy our intuition?
My submission for the 2023 TIPE (Travail d'Initiative Personelle Encadré). BGEYSNU is a bad game engine you should never use.

## What's the TIPE ?

It's a project you conduct on a specific theme to present at your oral exams in CPGE (french schools made to enter engineering schools). Essentially, you're presented a theme (in 2023 it was Games and Sports) and you have to develop a project that you will conduct entirely by yourself, to show your abilities at conceptualizing an idea, laying it down, making models to verify it, etc.
My project is making an engine supporting hyperbolic geometry and using it to create a game with interesting visual and theoretical implications.

## Contents

The "engine" file contains the main functions to create a hyperbolic plane tesselation, control the camera, and display it - The algorithms to do that are largely inspired (stolen) from HyperRogue (https://store.steampowered.com/app/342610/HyperRogue/) and a bunch of papers from Eryk Kopczyński. 
The "minesweeper" file is my version of Hyperbolic Minesweeper, mainly made to show how to use the "engine" and to illustrate how differently hyperbolic geometry behaves from our euclidean geometry (both visually and theoretically)

A big part of the repo is also a sort of dumpster for me to avoid losing files and keep track of old ideas
