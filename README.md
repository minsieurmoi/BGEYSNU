# TIPE 2023 - BGEYSNU : A Non Euclidean Game Engine
My submission for the 2023 TIPE (Travail d'Initiative Personelle Encadr√©). BGEYSNU is a bad game engine you should never use.

## What's the TIPE ?

It's a project you conduct on a specific theme to present at your oral exams in CPGE (french schools made to enter engineering schools). Essentially, you're presented a theme (in 2023 it was Games and Sports) and you have to come up with a project that you will conduct entirely by yourself, in order to show your abilities at conceptualizing an idea, laying it down, making models to verify your idea, etc.

## Why a github repo ?

I'm way too scared to loose some files and i prefer putting them online. It's also easier for me to link people to this page if i need their help. And i also think this kind of project is cool to post on github.

## How is the repo organized ?

Badly.

Have fun swimming through this whole mess.
